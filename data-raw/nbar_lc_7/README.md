    Version: This request was processed by AppEEARS version 3.40.2  

## 2. Request File Listing  

- Comma-separated values file with data extracted for a specific product
  - nbar-lc-7-MCD43A4-061-results.csv
- Text file with data pool URLs for all source granules used in the extraction
  - nbar-lc-7-granule-list.txt
- JSON request file which can be used in AppEEARS to create a new request
  - nbar-lc-7-request.json
- xml file
  - nbar-lc-7-MCD43A4-061-metadata.xml  

## 3. Point Sample Extraction Process  

Datasets available in AppEEARS are served via OPeNDAP (Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol) services. OPeNDAP services allow users to concisely pull pixel values from datasets via HTTPS requests. A middleware layer has been developed to interact with the OPeNDAP services. The middleware make it possible to extract scaled data values, with associated information, for pixels corresponding to a given coordinate and date range.

**NOTE:**  

- Requested date ranges may not match the reference date for multi-day products. AppEEARS takes an inclusive approach when extracting data for sample requests, often returning data that extends beyond the requested date range. This approach ensures that the returned data includes records for the entire requested date range.  
- For multi-day (8-day, 16-day, Monthly, Yearly) MODIS and S-NPP NASA VIIRS datasets, the date field in the data tables reflects the first day of the composite period.  
- If selected, the SRTM v3, ASTER GDEM v3 and Global Water Bodies Database v1, and NASADEM v1 product will be extracted regardless of the time period specified in AppEEARS because it is a static dataset. The date field in the data tables reflects the nominal SRTM date of February 11, 2000.  
- If the visualizations indicate that there are no data to display, proceed to downloading the .csv output file. Data products that have both categorical and continuous data values (e.g. MOD15A2H) are not able to be displayed within the visualizations within AppEEARS.  

## 4. Data Quality  

When available, AppEEARS extracts and returns quality assurance (QA) data for each data file returned regardless of whether the user requests it. This is done to ensure that the user possesses the information needed to determine the usability and usefulness of the data they get from AppEEARS. Most data products available through AppEEARS have an associated QA data layer. Some products have more than one QA data layer to consult. See below for more information regarding data collections/products and their associated QA data layers.  

### 4.1. MODIS (Terra, Aqua, & Combined)

All MODIS land products, as well as the MODIS Snow Cover Daily product, include quality assurance (QA) information designed to help users understand and make best use of the data that comprise each product. Results downloaded from AppEEARS and/or data directly requested via middleware services contain not only the requested pixel/data values but also the decoded QA information associated with each pixel/data value extracted.  

- See the MODIS Land Products QA Tutorials: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/resources/e-learning/> for more QA information regarding each MODIS land product suite.  
- See the MODIS Snow Cover Daily product user guide for information regarding QA utilization and interpretation.  

### 4.2. NASA MEaSUREs SRTM v3 (30m & 90m)  

SRTM v3 products are accompanied by an ancillary "NUM" file in place of the QA/QC files. The "NUM" files indicate the source of each SRTM pixel, as well as the number of input data scenes used to generate the SRTM v3 data for that pixel.  

- See the user guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/179/SRTM_User_Guide_V3.pdf> for additional information regarding the SRTM "NUM" file.  

### 4.3. GPW v4.11  

The GPW `Population Count`, `Population Density`, and `Basic Demographic Characteristics` data layers are accompanied by `Data Quality Indicators` datasets. The `Data Quality Indicators` were created to provide context for the population count and density grids, and to provide explicit information on the spatial precision of the input boundary data. The data context grid (data-context1) explains pixels with "0" population estimate in the population count and density grids, based on information included in the census documents. The mean administrative unit area grid (mean-admin-area2) measures the mean input unit size in square kilometers. It provides a quantitative surface that indicates the size of the input unit(s) from which the population count and density grids were created.  

### 4.4. S-NPP NASA VIIRS  

All S-NPP NASA VIIRS land products include quality information designed to help users understand and make best use of the data that comprise each product. For product-specific information, see the link to the S-NPP VIIRS products table provided in section 5.  

**NOTE:**  

- The S-NPP NASA VIIRS Surface Reflectance data products VNP09A1 and VNP09H1 contain two quality layers: `SurfReflect_State` and `SurfReflect_QC`. Both quality layers are provided to the user with the request results. Due to changes implemented on August 21, 2017 for forward processed data, there are differences in values for the `SurfReflect_QC` layer in VNP09A1 and `SurfReflect_QC_500` in VNP09H1.  
- Refer to the S-NPP NASA VIIRS Surface Reflectance User's Guide Version 1.1: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/123/VNP09_User_Guide_V1.1.pdf> for information on how to decode the `SurfReflect_QC` quality layer for data processed before August 21, 2017. For data processed on or after August 21, 2017, refer to the S-NPP NASA VIIRS Surface Reflectance User's guide Version 1.6: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/124/VNP09_User_Guide_V1.6.pdf>  

### 4.5. SMAP  

SMAP products provide multiple means to assess quality. Each data product contains bit flags, uncertainty measures, and file-level metadata that provide quality information. Results downloaded from AppEEARS and/or data directly requested via middleware services contain not only the requested pixel/data values, but also the decoded bit flag information associated with each pixel/data value extracted. For additional information regarding the specific bit flags, uncertainty measures, and file-level metadata contained in this product, refer to the Quality Assessment section of the user guide for the specific SMAP data product in your request: <https://nsidc.org/data/smap/smap-data.html>  

### 4.6. Daymet v4R1

Daymet station-level daily weather observation data and the corresponding Daymet model predicted data for three Daymet model parameters: minimum temperature (tmin), maximum temperature (tmax), and daily total precipitation (prcp) are available. These data provide information into the regional accuracy of the Daymet model for the three station-level input parameters. Corresponding comma separated value (.csv) files that contain metadata for every surface weather station for the variable-year combinations are also available. <https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2129>

### 4.7.1. ECOSTRESS Swath V1 and V2  

V1: Quality information varies by product for the ECOSTRESS product suite.

### 4.11. Landsat Collection 2 ARD

Landsat C2 U.S. Analysis Ready Data (ARD) products are available for conterminous United States (CONUS)(1982-Present), Alaska (1984-present), and Hawaii (1989-1993, 1999-present). These data are products of Landsat 8/9 Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2) / Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper (TM). The ARD significantly reduces the magnitude of data processing for application scientists. These data contain a quality assessment derived from Fmask version 3.3.1, Aerosol and Cloud QA derived from atmospheric compensation algorithms, and radiometric saturation QA derived from detector's input signal level. More details can be found in the Landsat Collection 2 U.S. ARD DFCB: <https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/media/files/LSDS-1435%20Landsat%20C2%20US%20ARD%20Data%20Format%20Control%20Book-v3.pdf>

### 4.11. US NPS Water Balance  

The US NPS Historical Water Balance products do not have associated QA files or layers.

## 5. Data Caveats  

### 5.1.1. ECOSTRESS Swath V1 and V2

- ECOSTRESS Swath data products are natively stored in swath format. To fulfill AppEEARS requests for ECOSTRESS Swath products, the data are first resampled from the native swath format to a georeferenced output. This requires the use of the requested ECOSTRESS product files and the corresponding ECO1BGEO: <https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO1BGEO.001> files for all ECOSTRESS Swath products. To do this conversion, an index array and distance array are created, then the nearest area pixel is located. Next, the Euclidean distance to that area pixel plus all surrounding pixels is measured within a 210 meter search radius (+/- a 3 pixels). This results in 49 pixels measured for every swath pixel. If the distance measured is less than what's currently present in any distance array, then the new distance as well as the swath index value are recorded into the index array used to convert to an area output.

### 5.1.2. ECOSTRESS Tiled V2

- It is not uncommon for many .csv cells returned to contain NaN values. If any layer requested or the QC layer contains valid data, the remaining requested layers will be returned even if only NaN values are present.

### 5.2. S-NPP VIIRS Land Surface Phenology Product (VNP22Q2.001)

- A subset of the science datasets/variables for VNP22Q2.001 are returned in their raw, unscaled form. That is, these variables are returned without having their scale factor and offset applied. AppEEARS visualizations and output summary files are derived using the raw data value, and consequently do not characterize the intended information ("day of year") for the impacted variables. The variables returned in this state include:  

    1. Date_Mid_Greenup_Phase (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    2. Date_Mid_Senescence_Phase (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    3. Onset_Greenness_Increase (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    4. Onset_Greenness_Decrease (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    5. Onset_Greenness_Maximum (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    6. Onset_Greenness_Minimum (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  

- To convert the raw data to "day of year" (doy) for the above variables, use the following equation:  

      doy = Raw_Data_Value * 1 – (Given_Year - 2000) * 366

### 5.3. SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer Global and Polar Grid Daily 9 km EASE-Grid Soil Moisture (SPL3SMP_E) Version 5

- The Version 5 release of SPL3SMP_E includes additional layers for AM and PM north-polar grid soil moisture retrievals. These additional layers are not supported in AppEEARS.

### 5.4. HLS v2.0

- When requesting HLS timeseries, note that Sentinel-2 launched after Landsat was already active. Landsat OLI (HLSL30 v002) products are available from 2013-04-11 to present, while Sentinel-2 MSI products (HLSS30 v002) are available from  2015-11-30 to present.
- Point requests are returned in geographic coordinates.  
- Extra granules may appear in the granule list output file if the target point is close to an area where MGRS tiles overlap.  

## 5.5 GPW v4.11  

- AppEEARS only provides access to GPW v4.11 Basic Demographic Characteristics estimates of population counts by age and sex for the year 2010. Estimates of population density by age and sex are not returned.  

## 5.6. 6.6 GEOLST4KHR v002

- The NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) GEOLST4KHR version 2 data product are natively stored in swath format. Similar to ECOSTRESS Swath data, GEOLST4KHR data are first resampled from the native swath format to a georectified output. This nearest-neighbor resampling process will result in accuracy lost. To do this conversion, an index array and distance array are created, then the nearest area pixel is located. Next, the spherical distance to that area pixel plus all surrounding pixels is measured within a 12 kilometer search radius (+/- 3 to 21 pixels). The pixel search radius is dynamic based on current swath observation latitude. If the distance measured is less than what's currently present in any distance array, then the new distance as well as the swath index value are recorded into the index array used to convert to an area output.

- GEOLST4KHR version 2 data product does not have any associated quality layer.
